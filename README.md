#Sortify
Sortify is a graphical tool that demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work. Built using C++ and the SDL2 library,
this project provides a dynamic and educational visualization of the steps involved in sorting a list of numbers. 
Whether you're a student learning about algorithms, a teacher explaining them, or just someone interested in sorting techniques, 
this visualizer offers a clear and interactive way to see these algorithms in action.

Key Features
.Fixed List Size: The visualizer uses a list of 130 elements to standardize the visualization.
.Randomization: Users can randomize the list to see how different algorithms handle various initial conditions.
.Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports six popular sorting algorithms:
1.Selection Sort
2.Insertion Sort
3.Bubble Sort
4.Merge Sort
5.Quick Sort
6.Heap Sort

.Visualization Delays: To make faster algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort easier to follow, 
the visualizer introduces delays, ensuring each step is visible.
.Interactive Interface: Simple controls to randomize the list and select sorting algorithms for visualization.

Controls:-
WARNING: Giving repetitive commands may cause latency and the visualizer may behave unexpectedly.
Please give a new command only after the current command's execution is done.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-

Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
